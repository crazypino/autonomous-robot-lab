# autonomous-robot-lab
The folder lab contains real codes using to ssh turtlebot and control turtlebot's behavoirs.
It is composed of cruise, following people avoiding obstacles and other behaviors.
The packages imported in codes depends on the sensors on turtlebot.

The folder simulation contains matlab codes about some autonmous robot algorithm. Apart from the algorithms used in
lab work, it consists of mapping algorithn like attractive fields, kalman filter and particle filter.
